With this project we were give the task to set up a website using two different API's. This project we decided to make a travel website for a for a European business traveler that will allow him to see a picture and flight cost for whatever city he enters. 

One API we added adds a picture into our carousel for whatever was searched. The other API pulls flight prices and info in.
